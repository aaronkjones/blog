I am a DevOps Engineer, based out of San Diego, California. I grew up in Tennessee and served in the United States Marine Corps in San Diego. I studied Computer Science and Information Systems at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. Since moving back to San Diego, I have worked as a DevOps Engineer at Qualcomm Incorporated.
